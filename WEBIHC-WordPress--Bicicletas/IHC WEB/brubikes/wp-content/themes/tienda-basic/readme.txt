== ABOUT TIENDA BASIC ==

Tienda Basic is an online storefront theme built specifically for WooCommerce. Set up a modern and beautifully designed eCommerce shop that works perfectly on handheld devices and desktops alike. With tons of great features and layout possibilities, Tienda will impress every customer while providing a smooth shopping experience. Also compatible with bbPress, BuddyPress and WPML. Uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability.

== NOTES ==

* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the URL parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
